# twitter-api-demo
A demo where the latest tweets on Twitter are filtered on a search string and displayed.

I wrote this as a code challenge in March of 2016. It doesn't use any code frameworks (not even JQuery) though it does behave like a modern one-page LAMP-stack webapp.  If you're anything like me, you probably like the imperative straightforward world of Vanilla JS.  

Consider this software completely license-free and public domain.

Shout out to Jonathan Skinner, who devised this exercise as part of the job interview process at Mercy For Animals (back before that place was ravaged by ayahuasca).
