# twitter-api-demo
A demo where the latest tweets on Twitter are filtered on a search string and displayed.

I wrote this as a code challenge in March of 2016. It doesn't use any code frameworks (not even JQuery) though it does behave like a modern one-page webapp.

Consider this software completely license-free and public domain.
